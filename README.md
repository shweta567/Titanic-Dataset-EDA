# Titanic-Dataset-EDA
This repository contains the code and analysis for my exploration of the Titanic dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into passenger demographics and factors influencing survival rates.

## Key Findings

- Explored the age distribution and survival rates.
- Analyzed the impact of family size on survival.
- Investigated passenger class and gender correlations with survival.
- Checked the correlation between different features.
- Explored the distribution of fares and survival rates.
  
## Feature Engineering

- Created a new feature 'FamilySize' by combining 'sibsp' and 'parch'.
- Introduced a new feature 'IsAlone' to identify whether a passenger was traveling alone.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
